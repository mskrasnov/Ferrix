A lightweight, fast and modern system information tool for Linux, built with Rust and Iced.

## What is Ferrix?

Ferrix is a Rust-crate and program for obtaining information about computer hardware and software. It is designed to work in modern Linux OS distributions.

## Motivation

For Linux, there are a bunch of different console programs for getting information about various PC and OS components. In addition, there is an amazing graphics program called Hardinfo (and its sequel, Hardinfo2). However, I wanted to write their simple analog with the following differences:

1. More complete support for modern Linux distributions: displaying information about systemd services, OS boot time, information about installed Flatpak packages, and the ability to reset GNOME environment settings (**NOTE:** I haven't implemented exactly these functions yet, but I plan to implement them in the future. They will be included in Ferrix v1.0);
2. I needed experience in developing a similar class of programs for Linux. Don't think that Ferrix is any kind of serious professional program ‚Äî it's just a student's "DIY", nothing more. Use it at your own risk.

## Features

### System Overview

- **Dashboard** with key system metrics at a glance;
- **Real time monitoring** of CPU, memory and others PC's components;
- **System health scoring** based on multiple factors.

### Hardware Information

- Processor details;
- Memory specifications;
- Storage information;
- Battery status;
- Data from DMI tables;

### Software Information

- Installed system;
- Kernel information;
- Users and groups;
- `systemd` services;

### User Experience

- **Modern, clean interface** based on [iced](https://iced.rs);
- **Minimal dependencies** (`systemd`, `glibc`);
- **Fast startup** and low memory footprint.

## Installation

```bash
cargo install ferrix-app
```

... or download pre-built binaries from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mskrasnov/ferrix/releases/latest)

... or build Ferrix from sources:
