## What is Ferrix?

Ferrix System Monitor is a Rust-crate and program for obtaining information about computer hardware and software. It is designed to work in modern Linux OS distributions.

## Functions (`ferrix-lib` crate)

1. Get information about:
    - [X] CPU;
    - [X] RAM;
    - [ ] [TODO] Storage;
    - [X] BIOS and PC Motherboard;
    - [X] Laptop battery;
    - [X] Installed Linux distribution;
    - [ ] Desktop environment;
    - [ ] Network;
    - [X] systemd services;
    - [X] `deb`, `rpm` packages;
    - [ ] flatpak packages;
2. Convert collected data into:
    - [X] JSON;
    - [X] XML;

## Functions (`ferrix-app` crate)

| Function | FSM (`ferrix-app`) | Hardinfo2 |
|----------|--------------------|-----------|
| Processor info | + | + |
| Memory usage | + | + |
| Storage info | - (TODO) | **+** |
| DMI Tables | **+** (TODO, but it already displays more data than Hardinfo) | + |
| RAM SPD Data | - | **+** |
| Battery | **+** (more correctly; without negative values) | + |
| Connected screens | + | + |
| Connected USB devices | - (TODO) | **+** |
| Connected PCI devices | - (TODO) | **+** |
| Installed distro | **+** (more data than Hardinfo) | + |
| Users and groups | + | + |
| systemd services | **+** | - |
| Installed software | **+** | - |
| Environment veriables | + | + |
| Sensors | - (TODO) | **+** |
| Network | - (TODO) | **+** |
| Kernel and modules | + | + |
| Printers | - | **+** |
| System load | + (loadavg, uptime); **+** (CPU & RAM Usage Charts) | + (loadavg, uptime); - (CPU & RAM Usage Charts is ugly and incorrect) |
| Hardware benchmarks | - | **+** |

## Build & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mskrasnov/Ferrix
cd Ferrix

make build
```

If you use Debian, perform:

```bash
make deb
```

And install `deb`-package:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i ./target/${TARGET_ARCH}/debian/ferrix-app_${VERSION}-${BUILD_NUM}_${ARCH}.deb
```

If you use other Linux system, perform:

```bash
make run # to run Ferrix...
# ... or
make install # to install Ferrix.
# Perform:
make uninstall # to uninstall Ferrix from your system.
```

### Cross compilation (Debian x86_64 glibc -> i686/AArch64 glibc)

Install the cross-compilator:

```bash
sudo dpkg --add-architecture {arm64/i686}
sudo apt update

# For AArch64:
sudo apt install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu binutils-aarch64-linux-gnu libc6-dev-arm64-cross
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu

# For i686:
sudo apt install gcc-12-i686-linux-gnu binutils-i686-linux-gnu
rustup target add i686-unknown-linux-gnu
```

Build Ferrix:

```bash
cargo build [--release] --target={i686,aarch64}-unknown-linux-gnu
# or:
make TARGET={i686/aarch64}-unknown-linux-gnu build
```

## Technology stack

- **OS:** Linux with `glibc`, `dbus` and `systemd`;
- **Programming language:** Rust 1.88+ (2024 edition);
- **GUI:** [`iced`](https://iced.rs);
